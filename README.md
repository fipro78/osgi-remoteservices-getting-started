# Getting Started with OSGi Remote Services
This repository contains the sources for the blog posts for getting started with OSGi Remote Services.
The implementation uses the Eclipse Communication Framework (ECF).

There are implementations based on:
- Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Development Environment)
- Bndtools
- OSGi enRoute Maven Archetypes

This way it should be possible for many people to follow the tutorial, without being blocked by the used tooling.
